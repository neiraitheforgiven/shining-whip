# shining-whip
a prototype for a single-axis tactical RPG. For prototyping purposes, temporarily inspired by OG Shining Force.

I really need to separate the files up better.

To run the game, start up battleMap.py and type stop into the first prompt. Game currently runs for 3 stable battles and one untested one.
